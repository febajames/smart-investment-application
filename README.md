Using historical loan data from Lending Club in the US for all loans issued from 2007 through 2015, a prediction model using logistic
regression has been built to predict the loan repayment probabilities of potential borrowers. This has been put together in an
interactive RShiny application that will allow investors using Lending Club to access borrower information and shortlist interesting borrowers.
